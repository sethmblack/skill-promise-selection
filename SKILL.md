# Promise Selection

Choose the right benefit to lead with in your advertising. The promise is the most important decision after positioning - get it wrong and no amount of creative brilliance will save you.

---

## When to Use

- Choosing which benefit to emphasize in advertising
- A/B testing strategy development
- Messaging hierarchy decisions
- When multiple features compete for attention
- User asks "What should I promise?" or "Which benefit should I lead with?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| product | Yes | What you're selling |
| benefits | Yes | List of potential benefits to promise |
| audience | Yes | Who you're targeting |
| competitors | No | What promises competitors make |
| research | No | Any customer feedback or data |

---

## Ogilvy's Promise Framework

### Why Promise Selection Matters
"The selection of the right promise is so vitally important that you should never rely on guesswork to decide it."

The promise is the single benefit you lead with - the reason you give consumers to choose you. Everything else in your advertising supports this promise.

### The Danger of Guesswork
Most advertisers choose their promise based on:
- What the product team is excited about
- What sounds good in meetings
- What the CEO wants to say
- What competitors are saying

All of these are wrong. The only right answer is: what makes customers buy?

### Ogilvy's Research Methods
At Ogilvy & Mather, five research techniques were used to find the most powerful promise:

1. **Promise Rating:** Show consumers multiple promises; have them rate each for importance and uniqueness

2. **Split-Run Testing:** Write two ads with different promise headlines; run to split audiences; measure which generates more response

3. **Customer Research:** Interview existing customers about why they bought; look for patterns

4. **Competitive Gap Analysis:** Identify promises competitors aren't making that customers want

5. **Benefit Hierarchy Testing:** Ask customers to rank benefits in order of importance

---

## The Promise Evaluation Framework

For each potential promise, evaluate:

### 1. Importance to the Customer (0-10)
Does the customer actually care about this benefit? A promise that doesn't matter won't persuade.

### 2. Uniqueness in the Market (0-10)
Are competitors already making this promise? A commoditized promise doesn't differentiate.

### 3. Believability (0-10)
Will customers believe you can deliver? An incredible promise creates skepticism.

### 4. Demonstrability (0-10)
Can you prove this promise? Promises you can demonstrate are stronger than claims you assert.

### 5. Sustainability (0-10)
Can you own this promise long-term? Or can competitors easily copy it?

---

## The Promise Matrix

| Promise | Importance | Uniqueness | Believability | Demonstrability | Sustainability | Total |
|---------|------------|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Promise A | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | /50 |
| Promise B | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | /50 |
| Promise C | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | /50 |

**Scoring:**
- 40-50: Strong promise candidate - test for confirmation
- 30-39: Viable but may need refinement
- 20-29: Weak - likely won't differentiate
- Below 20: Discard

## Constraints

- Never guess when you can test
- The best promise is often not the most obvious
- What excites the product team may not excite customers
- Promises must be true and deliverable
- Uniqueness without importance is worthless; importance without uniqueness is commoditized

## Promise Selection Analysis

### Product
Smart home security camera

### Target Audience
Homeowners concerned about package theft and break-ins

### Competitive Context
- Ring: Dominates with brand recognition; requires subscription ($100+/year)
- Nest: Google ecosystem integration; also subscription
- Wyze: Low price; basic features; concerns about reliability

### Promise Evaluation

**Promise 1: "4K video quality"**
| Criterion | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Importance | 6 | Nice to have but not top concern. Most theft is caught on 1080p fine. |
| Uniqueness | 4 | Many competitors offer 4K or near-4K |
| Believability | 9 | Easy to believe - spec is objective |
| Demonstrability | 9 | Can show comparison footage |
| Sustainability | 3 | Easy to copy; becomes table stakes quickly |
| **Total** | **31/50** | |

**Promise 2: "AI-powered person detection"**
| Criterion | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Importance | 8 | Reduces false alerts - a real pain point |
| Uniqueness | 5 | Ring and Nest have this; Wyze is weak here |
| Believability | 7 | AI claims are sometimes overstated; need proof |
| Demonstrability | 8 | Can show side-by-side with motion-only cameras |
| Sustainability | 6 | Requires ongoing AI development to stay ahead |
| **Total** | **34/50** | |

**Promise 3: "No monthly subscription fees"**
| Criterion | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Importance | 10 | #1 complaint about Ring is the subscription cost |
| Uniqueness | 9 | Ring/Nest require subscription; this is rare at quality level |
| Believability | 10 | Clear, verifiable claim |
| Demonstrability | 10 | TCO comparison over 3 years is compelling |
| Sustainability | 8 | Business model decision; hard for subscription companies to reverse |
| **Total** | **47/50** | |

**Promise 4: "2-way audio"**
| Criterion | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Importance | 6 | Useful but not primary buying criteria |
| Uniqueness | 2 | Everyone has this now |
| Believability | 9 | Standard feature |
| Demonstrability | 8 | Easy to show |
| Sustainability | 1 | Completely commoditized |
| **Total** | **26/50** | |

**Promise 5: "Works when WiFi is down (cellular backup)"**
| Criterion | Score | Analysis |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Importance | 8 | Addresses real fear - criminals cutting internet |
| Uniqueness | 9 | Most cameras fail when WiFi fails; this is rare |
| Believability | 9 | Technical claim that can be proven |
| Demonstrability | 10 | Dramatic demo: unplug router, camera keeps working |
| Sustainability | 7 | Requires hardware investment; not easy to copy quickly |
| **Total** | **43/50** | |

### Recommendation

**Lead Promise:** "No monthly subscription fees"
**Rationale:** Highest score (47/50). This directly attacks Ring's biggest weakness and is the #1 complaint in the category. It's completely believable, easily demonstrated with TCO math, and hard for subscription-dependent competitors to counter. This is the Dove positioning moment - attacking where the market leader is most vulnerable.

**Supporting Promises:**
1. "Works when WiFi is down" - Differentiates from Wyze (cheap but unreliable) and addresses real security concern
2. "AI-powered person detection" - Establishes quality parity with Ring/Nest

**Rationale:** The story becomes: "Real security without the ongoing cost. Works even when they cut your internet. Smart enough to know a person from a passing car."

### Testing Plan
1. A/B test landing pages: "No subscription" headline vs. "Works without WiFi" headline
2. Survey existing security camera owners: rank purchase criteria
3. Success metrics: Conversion rate difference of >10% indicates clear winner

### The Ogilvy Perspective
You have a gift in "no subscription" - a clear, factual, differentiated promise that attacks the market leader's core weakness. Ring's entire business model creates an ongoing pain point for customers, and you can solve it.

Do not bury this promise among features. Lead with it. Make it your headline. Your positioning is not "better camera" - it's "real security without the subscription trap."

The consumer isn't a moron. She knows what she pays Ring every year. She does the math. Tell her there's another way, and prove it with a simple comparison:

"Ring: $200 camera + $500 in subscriptions over 5 years = $700"
"You: $249 camera + $0 = $249"

Facts sell. This fact is your weapon.
